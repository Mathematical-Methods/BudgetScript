# BudgetScript
This project is a Python script which (in its current form) reads receipt names and generates a report.txt file from the content of the receipt file names.

## Why is this useful? 
This project is useful for me because it provides data on my spending (and a document for redundancy) that can be used to make better budget oriented decisions in the future.

## What are the current and upcoming features?
In the present, this script operates on a list of receipt names (generated by me, manually) and creates a report.txt file as shown below:

Features like receipt OCR, relevant information extraction and subsequent expense classification are in the works. 

Additionally, there are plans to enable .OFX file generation for use with common personal finance managers like Denaro, GNU Cash, etc.
